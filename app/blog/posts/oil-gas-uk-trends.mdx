I have long been interested in the factors that influence energy markets. When I encountered the UK government's dataset on the **Supply and Use of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Liquids**, I recognised an excellent opportunity to apply data analytics to a subject that matters to me.

In this project, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to examine trends in domestic production, imports, exports, and stock changes. This approach provided a clearer picture of the market dynamics and helped identify key indicators affecting energy supply and demand.

Working on this analysis allowed me to further develop my skills in data cleaning, visualisation, and statistical exploration, while also deepening my understanding of the complexities within the energy sector. The process of transforming raw government data into insights was both challenging and rewarding.

For a complete breakdown of my approach, including the notebook and code, please see the project on GitHub: [UK Govt Energy Analysis](https://github.com/arjunsekhon/uk_govt_energy_analysis).

I look forward to further exploring the intersection of energy, data, and technology as I continue to grow in this field.
