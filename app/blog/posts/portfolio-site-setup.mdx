I decided to take a leap and build my portfolio site. This project has been rewarding, offering me hands-on experience with setting up a production-ready website and deepening my understanding of modern front-end development.

**Domain Setup and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**  
Setting up the domain was novel and exciting. I registered my domain via AWS and configured Route 53 by setting up a hosted zone, NS, and A records to point to Vercel’s servers. This experience helped me understand DNS management and the CI/CD process.

**Discovering Tailwind CSS:**  
Tailwind CSS has impressed me with it's simplicity in styling pages and makes creating layouts straightforward. The [documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/styling-with-utility-classes) is excellent which means, I can focus on content and functionality.

**Why I Built This Site:**  
Beyond showcasing my work in understanding energy, power and data analytics, this project was a chance to learn and experiment with technologies like Next.js, React and cloud computing. Building this site has refined my technical skills and given me the confidence to deploy and manage a live website.

Stay tuned for more updates as I explore the intersection of energy, data, and technology!
