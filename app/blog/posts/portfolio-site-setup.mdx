I decided to take a leap and build my own portfolio site. This project has been a rewarding journey, offering me hands-on experience with setting up a production-ready website and deepening my understanding of modern front-end development.

**Domain Setup and Deployment:**  
Setting up the domain was an exciting challenge. I registered my domain via AWS and configured Route 53 by setting up hosted zones, NS, and A records to point to Vercel’s servers. This experience was a real eye-opener in DNS management and the deployment process.

**Discovering Tailwind CSS:**  
I’ve been curious about utility-first CSS frameworks, and Tailwind CSS has truly impressed me. Its simplicity in styling pages and creating layouts made the design process straightforward and enjoyable. With Tailwind, I could focus on content and functionality rather than getting bogged down with custom CSS.

**Why I Built This Site:**  
Beyond showcasing my work in energy markets and data analytics, this project was a chance to learn and experiment with technologies like Next.js, React, and Vercel. Building this site has not only refined my technical skills but also given me the confidence to deploy and manage a live website.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to explore the intersection of energy, data, and technology!
